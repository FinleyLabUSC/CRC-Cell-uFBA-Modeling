## Introduction
**Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)** play a key role in metabolic reprogramming and are well-established contributors to drug resistance in **colorectal cancer (CRC)**. To exploit this metabolic crosstalk, we integrated a **systems biology** approach that identified key metabolic targets in a **data-driven** method and validated them experimentally. This process involved high-throughput computational screening to investigate the effects of enzyme perturbations predicted by a computational model of CRC metabolism to understand **system-wide effects** efficiently. Our results highlighted hexokinase (HK) as one of the crucial targets, which subsequently became our focus for **experimental validation** using **patient-derived tumor organoids (PDTOs)**. Through metabolic imaging and viability assays, we found that PDTOs cultured in CAF conditioned media exhibited increased sensitivity to HK inhibition. Our approach emphasizes the critical role of **integrating computational and experimental techniques** in exploring and exploiting **CRC-CAF crosstalk**.
